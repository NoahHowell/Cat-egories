l0GrHNt6P3Y,I Confronted My Cat’s Online Haters & This Is What Happened,"Apparently my cat has haters. I know. It sounds ridiculous. But every time I post a video of Chip, people assume something terrible happened to his tail. Some report the video. Some leave comments calling him abused. Some even say he needs to be rescued.  This video is the full story of what actually happened and what went down when I finally confronted the people who were spreading misinformation about him. Chip is a Manx cat which means he was born without a tail. There is no injury. No harm. Just genetics and one very confident cat who has no idea there is a debate about him online.  In this video I talk about why Manx cats look the way they do, what the tailless gene is, why his videos get reported, and how the internet reacted when people stepped up to defend him. If you have ever seen a tailless cat or wondered why some cats are born without tails, this will answer everything.  Thank you to everyone who continues to support Chip and helps correct the misinformation. You make a huge difference and Chip would thank you himself if he could stop stealing my snacks long enough to speak.",2025-11-25T15:02:39Z,,,PT4M47S,612,129,47
